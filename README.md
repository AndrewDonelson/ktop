# ktop
ktop is a terminal UI (TUI) monitoring tool for Kubernetes clusters, similar to htop for Linux or nvtop for GPUs. It provides real-time visualization of cluster resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, GPU) across nodes and pods, allowing cluster administrators to monitor resource consumption at a glance.
